# glossary-request

If there is a new object/concept that needs to be named and defined, you can use a glossary in order to ensure that everybody you work with uses the same name for the same object/concept.

With the following glossary request, people can apply two kinds of requests to the person in charge of the glossary: The request for a new glossary entry or the request for a change of an existing glossary entry.

Please note that this glossary request is designed for the specific processes of a company.
